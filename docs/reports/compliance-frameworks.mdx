## Generating Compliance Reports

### Single Framework

```bash
aiptx report generate \
  --scan-id scan_abc123 \
  --template compliance \
  --compliance soc2
```

### Multiple Frameworks

```bash
aiptx report generate \
  --scan-id scan_abc123 \
  --template compliance \
  --compliance soc2,pci,hipaa
```

### Configuration File

```yaml
report:
  template: compliance
  compliance_frameworks:
    - soc2
    - pci_dss_v4
    - iso27001
  include_evidence: true
  include_remediation: true
  executive_summary: true
```

## Audit Evidence

### Evidence Package

AIPTx can generate an evidence package for auditors:

```bash
aiptx report evidence --scan-id scan_abc123 --framework soc2
```

Includes:
- Scan configuration and scope
- Complete findings with timestamps
- Proof of concept evidence
- Remediation tracking
- Historical trend data

### Continuous Compliance

Track compliance status over time:

```
