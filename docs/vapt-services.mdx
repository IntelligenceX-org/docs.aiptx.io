## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is the difference between VA and PT?">
    **Vulnerability Assessment (VA)** identifies and classifies security weaknesses through automated scanning. **Penetration Testing (PT)** goes further by actively exploiting vulnerabilities to demonstrate real-world impact. AIPTx combines both in a comprehensive VAPT approach.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How often should I perform VAPT?">
    For compliance and best practices, organizations should perform VAPT:
    - **Continuously** for production applications (AIPTx automated)
    - **After major releases** via CI/CD integration
    - **Quarterly** for compliance requirements (SOC 2, PCI-DSS)
    - **Annually** for comprehensive manual review
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is AIPTx VAPT accepted for compliance audits?">
    Yes. AIPTx generates audit-ready reports with evidence packages that satisfy requirements for SOC 2, ISO 27001, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, and other frameworks. Our reports are accepted by major audit firms.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can AIPTx test authenticated applications?">
    Yes. AIPTx supports complex authentication scenarios including:
    - Session-based authentication
    - JWT/Bearer tokens
    - OAuth 2.0 flows
    - Multi-factor authentication
    - Custom authentication schemes
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does AIPTx compare to manual penetration testing?">
    AIPTx complements manual pentesting by providing continuous, scalable coverage. While manual testing is valuable for complex business logic and novel attack vectors, AIPTx automates 90%+ of standard security testing, allowing human experts to focus on high-value assessments.
