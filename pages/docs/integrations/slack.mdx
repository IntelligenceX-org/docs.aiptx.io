```

### Per-Project Channels

Configure channels for specific projects:

    channel: "#webapp-security"
    notify_on: [critical, high]
  api:
    channel: "#api-security"
    notify_on: [critical, high, medium]
```

## Slash Commands

AIPTx adds slash commands to your Slack workspace:

### `/aiptx scan`

Start a quick scan from Slack:

```
/aiptx scan https://example.com
```

Options:
```
/aiptx scan https://example.com --mode quick
/aiptx scan https://example.com --mode standard
```

### `/aiptx status`

Check status of running scans:

```
/aiptx status
```

## Interactive Messages

### Finding Actions

When a finding is posted, team members can take action directly from Slack:

- **👀 View Details** - Open finding in AIPTx dashboard
- **✅ Mark Fixed** - Update finding status
- **🔇 Mute** - Suppress future alerts for this finding
- **📋 Create Ticket** - Create Jira/Linear issue

### Scan Actions

- **📊 View Report** - Open scan report
- **🔄 Rescan** - Start a new scan with same config
- **⬇️ Download** - Get PDF report

## Workflow Automation

### Slack Workflow Builder

Create automated workflows triggered by AIPTx events:

**Example: Critical Finding Escalation**

1. AIPTx posts critical finding
2. Workflow adds reaction and threads response
3. Creates incident channel
4. Pages on-call engineer via PagerDuty

### Webhooks

For custom integrations, use webhook endpoints:

```bash
POST https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL
```

AIPTx can send raw JSON payloads:

```json
{
  "event": "finding.critical",
  "scan_id": "scan_abc123",
  "finding": {
    "id": "finding_xyz789",
    "title": "SQL Injection in User Search",
    "severity": "critical",
    "cvss_score": 9.8,
    "endpoint": "/api/users/search"
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T12:30:00Z"
}
```

## Configuration via API

Configure Slack integration programmatically:

```bash
# Set notification preferences
curl -X PUT "https://api.aiptx.io/v1/integrations/slack" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "default_channel": "#security-alerts",
    "notifications": {
      "scan_completed": true,
      "critical_finding": true,
      "high_finding": true,
      "weekly_summary": true
    }
  }'
```

## Troubleshooting


  #### Not receiving notifications

    1. Verify Slack is connected in Settings → Integrations
    2. Check the bot has access to the target channel
    3. Ensure notification types are enabled
  

  #### Slash commands not working

    1. Reinstall the Slack app
    2. Verify your user has permission to use slash commands
    3. Check the command syntax
  

  #### Too many notifications

    Adjust notification settings to only receive critical and high severity alerts, or route to a dedicated channel.
