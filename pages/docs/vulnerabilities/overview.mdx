## Detection Methodology

AIPTx uses multiple techniques to detect vulnerabilities:

### Static Analysis

- Pattern matching for known vulnerabilities
- Code structure analysis
- Configuration review
- Dependency scanning

### Dynamic Analysis

- Intelligent fuzzing with context awareness
- Behavioral analysis
- Response comparison
- Time-based detection

### AI-Powered Detection

- Contextual payload generation
- Anomaly detection
- Pattern learning
- Business logic analysis

## Severity Classification

AIPTx uses CVSS 3.1 for severity scoring:

| Severity | CVSS Score | Description |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| **Critical** | 9.0 - 10.0 | Immediate exploitation risk, severe impact |
| **High** | 7.0 - 8.9 | Significant risk, potential data breach |
| **Medium** | 4.0 - 6.9 | Moderate risk, limited impact |
| **Low** | 0.1 - 3.9 | Minor risk, minimal impact |
| **Info** | 0.0 | Informational findings |

## Coverage by Scan Mode

| Vulnerability Type | Quick | Standard | Deep |
|--------------------|-------|----------|------|
| OWASP Top 10 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Business Logic | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Race Conditions | ❌ | ⚠️ | ✅ |
