# API Introduction

The AIPTx API provides programmatic access to all platform features, enabling you to integrate AI-powered penetration testing into your workflows.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://api.aiptx.io/v1
```

## Authentication

The AIPTx API uses Bearer token authentication. Include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.aiptx.io/v1/scans" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Getting Your API Key

1. Log in to the [AIPTx Dashboard](https://app.aiptx.io)
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **API Keys**
3. Click **Generate New Key**
4. Copy and securely store your key

<Warning>
API keys provide full access to your account. Never share them or commit them to version control. Use environment variables instead.
</Warning>

## Request Format

### Headers

All requests should include:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
```

### Request Body

POST and PUT requests accept JSON bodies:

```json
{
  "target": "https://example.com",
  "mode": "standard",
  "options": {
    "authentication": {
      "type": "bearer",
      "token": "your_app_token"
    }
  }
}
```

## Response Format

All responses are returned in JSON format:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "scan_abc123",
    "status": "running",
    "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  },
  "meta": {
    "request_id": "req_xyz789"
  }
}
```

### Error Responses

Errors follow a consistent format:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "INVALID_TARGET",
    "message": "The provided target URL is not accessible",
    "details": {
      "target": "https://invalid.example.com",
      "reason": "DNS resolution failed"
    }
  },
  "meta": {
    "request_id": "req_xyz789"
  }
}
```

## HTTP Status Codes

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `200` | Success |
| `201` | Resource created |
| `400` | Bad request - Invalid parameters |
| `401` | Unauthorized - Invalid or missing API key |
| `403` | Forbidden - Insufficient permissions |
| `404` | Not found - Resource doesn't exist |
| `429` | Rate limited - Too many requests |
| `500` | Server error - Something went wrong |

## Rate Limits

API requests are rate limited based on your plan:

| Plan | Requests/minute | Concurrent Scans |
|------|-----------------|------------------|
| Starter | 60 | 1 |
| Professional | 120 | 4 |
| Business | 300 | 10 |
| Enterprise | Custom | Custom |

Rate limit headers are included in every response:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 60
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 58
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1705312800
```

## Pagination

List endpoints support pagination:

```bash
GET /v1/scans?page=1&limit=20
```

Paginated responses include metadata:

```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "pagination": {
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 20,
    "total": 156,
    "total_pages": 8
  }
}
```

## Versioning

The API is versioned via the URL path (`/v1/`). We maintain backward compatibility within major versions. Breaking changes will be introduced in new major versions with advance notice.

## Quick Example

Here's a complete example of starting a scan and retrieving results:

```python
import aiptx

# Initialize client
client = aiptx.Client(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# Start a scan
scan = client.scans.create(
    target="https://example.com",
    mode="standard"
)

print(f"Scan started: {scan.id}")

# Wait for completion
scan.wait_for_completion()

# Get findings
findings = client.findings.list(scan_id=scan.id)

for finding in findings:
    print(f"[{finding.severity}] {finding.title}")
```
